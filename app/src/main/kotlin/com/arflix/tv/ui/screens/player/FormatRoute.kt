/**
 * Which decoder path a format is given before anything has failed. Ported from TMPlayer.
 *
 * Dolby Vision first, the format that most often played as sound over a black screen. A Dolby
 * Vision track is a plain HEVC (or AVC) picture, the base layer, with Dolby's metadata beside it,
 * and for every profile but 5 that base layer is a complete HDR10, HLG or SDR picture of its own.
 * Media3 falls back to it only for profiles 4, 8 and 9 and only on MediaCodec, and the FFmpeg
 * decoder does not know the Dolby Vision type at all, so profile 7 (the Blu-ray remuxes, the
 * enhancement layer interleaved as NAL types an HEVC decoder skips) found no decoder on a device
 * or screen without Dolby Vision, and a profile 8 film too large for the hardware had no software
 * path. Where the device would not show it as Dolby Vision anyway, the track is relabelled as its
 * base layer, the way Kodi, Jellyfin and Just Player do, and then both decoders can take it.
